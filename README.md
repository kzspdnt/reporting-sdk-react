# Euvic Mobile SDK React Native

## System Requirements

Android 7.0+\
iOS 13.0+

## Installation

### Android

Add this dependency to your module's `build.gradle` file:

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
dependencies {
	...
	implementation("io.github.clickonometrics.android:clickonometrics:1.0")
}
```

**Groovy**
```groovy
dependencies {
	...
	implementation 'io.github.clickonometrics.android:clickonometrics:1.0'
}
```

You need is to copy native bridge files [EuvicSdkTrackerAndroidPackage.java]() and [EuvicMobile.java]() to your project. 
Rememeber to add ```java packages.add(new EuvicSdkTrackerAndroidPackage());``` line to your [MainApplication.java]() file.

### iOS

The library is available via Cocapods so you need add dependency to your Podfile
```
pod 'EuvicMobileSDK', '~> 0.2.0'
```

You can also use framework binary file `EuvicMobileSDK.xcframework` and add it to your project.

All you need is to copy native bridge files [EuvicMobileBridge.m]() and [EuvicMobile.swift]() to your project. 

And add following import to your project bridging header:
```obj-c
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
```

You can now use the library in the React Native codebase. 

## Configuration

Before sending events configuration is required. We recommend to do it just after starting the app, because all events submitted earlier will not be sent.
Simply add the following code to your AppDelegate.swift

```typescript
  import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

  const url = 'https://delivery.clickonometrics.pl/tracker=multi/track/multi/track.json';
  const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
  NativeModules.EuvicMobile.configure(url, apiKey, null, null, true);
```
